# bokeh

That's where I keep my baby steps with using bokeh. The main effort here is to produce ipython notebooks with streaming plots of various kinds (scatterplots, histograms, box-and-whisker plots).

## Streaming notebooks

If you decide to clone this repo:

Head over to the /live-notebook direcory. There you can run streaming plots.

Open DataGenerator.ipynb and run it. It will start producing json reports in the /reports directory

Open DataConsumer.ipynb and run the kind of streaming plot you are interested in producimg.
